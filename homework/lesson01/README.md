## Exercises

Read: [Git book - first 3 chapters](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

You can start practicing writing HTML for pages that are described below. Even if you aren't sure yet how to structure something, give it your best - in the next lesson, we will learn HTML in-depth, alongside the best practices for using it. You will then be able to come back to these exercises and fix them. This will give you first-hand experience in improving code.

### Google page

Write **only the markup** for [Google's first page](https://www.google.com/).

Make sure to use appropriate HTML tags for each of the elements.
**Do not worry about styling yet, try to just get the markup right**.
The idea of this exercise is to distinguish between structure and visuals when building web pages.
Typically, we should first design HTML, and then go on to styling and adding interactivity.

The benefit of implementing the markup of a page is that you can also use the browser inspector to find out which tags the site is using.

You can export images directly from the site using the inspector.

### Povio page

Write **only the markup** for [Povio's landing page](https://povio.com/) - you can just do the topmost section.

The idea is the same as in the previous exercise.
Don't worry about animations, popups and anything else that might fly across the screen - just focus on figuring out how to structure the site without visuals. The skill of separating visuals and structure is very important for front-end developers.

You can export images directly from the site using the inspector.
