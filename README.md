# Submitting homework

Nobody likes homework, but if you want to master the concepts in the lessons, you must practice regularly and consistently.
It is better to practice for a few minutes per day, rather than multiple hours only occasionally.

Each lesson will have a subfolder for homework, which will contain a list of the exercises to work on.
You can work on the exercise directly in this repository - unless you want to deploy to Netlify (we will learn about that [soon](../07_Netlify/README.md)), then you should create a new repository.

If working within the repository, you can create a subfolder for each homework exercise inside the homework subfolder, and then open that folder in VSCode, so it will only show the files for that exercise.

## Reviews

You can request a review of your homework code from mentors while the academy is ongoing.
This will give you a unique insight into your code - you will receive feedback on what was done right and what could be improved.
We strongly suggest that you use this opportunity to get feedback on your work.

Reviewing will be done the same way as it is done in a professional environment - using Github. We will learn more about this [soon](../05_GitHub/README.md):

- First, make sure that the reviewers are added to the members of the repository (check Slack).
- Create a new branch
- Work on your exercise on that branch
- When ready, create a PR to merge into _main_ and then request a review from the user `izakgl`.

If you push directly to _main_ (not recommended), you can also request a review by posting it directly into Slack.

It is also encouraged that the students review each other's code.
You not only learn by getting a review from someone else, but also by reviewing someone else's code.
Apart from this, code reviews are an everyday part of being a professional developer.

If you want to review other student's code, let us know on Slack or in person, and we will introduce you to the process. After you will complete your review, one of our mentors is then going to do a review of your review and the original code. This way both the reviewer and the student who wrote the code will get feedback.
